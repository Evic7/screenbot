##super arguments
these are  screenbot special arguments that carry special functions
all special arguments starts with ?
here are some special arguments
?run // used by some commands to run other commands
?else // used by if command to perform else functions
?arg // used for adding arguments to run label command
?int  // convert to integer
?calc  // can perform calculations 
?var // can call variables in places normal texts or commands can't
?exec // execute and replace command return values if available
?raw // raw string no parsing
?str // parses texts eg \n becomes new line can also use ?str-lower to parse with lowercase or ?str-upper to parse with uppercase

Example:

emit add 1000 and 23335 and 300 = ?calc "1000 + 23335 + 300"
emit ?str-lower "CHANGE TO LOWER CASE"

Global super argument
Super arguments that can be called any where in a command argument and does not need to be called with a specific command is called a global 
super argument
Example:

~~ normal super argument

if ({{name}} ?equ john) ?run msg hi john ?else msg not john

~Global super argument 
emit ?str "Today is friday.\nAnd am so happy"

Tip: global super arguments supports parenthesis example: emit ?str (Today is friday.\nAnd am so happy)
##EachOnScreen

Iterate over multiple instances of an image on the screen.Syntax:eachOnScreen imagepath ?run command: Execute a command 
for each image instance, using {{imageX}} and {{imageY}} for positions.

Description: Loops through all occurrences of an image, executing the specified command for each. Useful for batch 
processing GUI elements.
Example:
eachOnScreen textfile.png ?run move {{imageX}} {{imageY}} 5  ~~  Move to each text file icon

Use Case: Open multiple text files visible on the desktop by clicking their icons.
NOTE: only jpg and png are supported

##Image Commands

Interact with on-screen images for precise automation.
SeeImage:Detect if an image is present on the screen.
Syntax:seeImage imagepath: Returns true if the image is found, false otherwise.
seeImage imagepath left top width height: Check within a specific screen region.

Description: Uses computer vision to detect images, supporting automation in dynamic UIs.
Example:

if seeImage login.png ?run click ?else msg Login button not found

~~  Check for logo in a 300x300 region
seeImage logo.png 100 100 300 300  

Use Case: Verify the presence of a “Login” button before proceeding.
NOTE: only jpg and png are supported


##labels
labels are one of the most important part in screenbot scripts,they act as checkpoints in script
there are two types of label 
1) normal label : these are normal label in screenbot scripts and can be controlled by the run command
example: 

~~ create a label

newlabel:
command here
~~ end the label
end:

~~ run a label

run newlabel:

2) transparent label : these are special label that hides its content when executed and its content can only be executed when
called by the run command its label names starts with _

example:
~~ create a transparent label
_newtransparentlabel:
command here
~~ end the label
end:

~~ run a transparent label

run _newtransparentlabel:

##Run Commands
Execute scripts, labels, or commands with arguments.
Run:Run external scripts or specific labels.
Syntax:run script.as: Run an external script.
run label: Run a label in the current script.
run script.as label: Run an external script starting from a label 

Description: Enables modular scripting by running external scripts or specific sections (labels) with optional arguments.
The run command beheaves differently in the way its called 

1) the run script.as : this run method runs a new ".as" script given by the user clearing all old script temporary data and
labels being executed before
2) the run script.as label: : same as run script.as but instead it jumps to a label specified by the user and start from there
3) the run label: : this one works different from other run method it uses four stages 
i) find the label given by the user in screenbot label cache 
ii) collect all commands under the label into a temporary command holder {destroys existing command holder and create a new 
one if any command is stll executing in the temporary command holder (this means it will stop collecting commands once another
label is discovered)} 
iii) execute commands collected 
iv) destroy temporary command holder    



Example:
run processFiles: ?arg file1.txt file2.txt


run mover:

mover:
~~  Move to (100, 200) at speed 5
move 100 200 5 
end:

NOTE: always notify the end of a label with end: so screebot can know where the label stops


##QuickRun
Run a command and exit immediately.
Syntax:quickRun command: Execute a single command and terminate the script.

Example:

quickRun msg ScreenBot4 completed the task!

Use Case: Display a one-time notification without running a full script.


##Wait Command

##The variable holder command

you can hold the value of a variable by passing it as an argument using the getValue command

Example getValue time (do not include the double brackets {{ }} )

this is needed when checking a variable in if command because (if) command runs command and 
holds the result because of this it cannot directly run variables that holds value instead of 
command so with this you can do
\
get {{mousex}} mousePositionX

~~  LATER ON YOU CAN PARSE THE VARIABLE WITHOUT RUNNING mousePositionX AGAIN

if not getValue mousex ?grtn 200 ?run msg your last mouse x position was not greater than 200





##stop or stopScript command 

stops running script without exiting screenBot
it works same as end but do not exit screenBot 

Syntax:end :stops script and exit screenBot
stop or stopScript:stops running script only, does not close screenBot

##exit

stops current running labels without stopping script
does nothing when running on shell or running a script
only used in label to break out of labels
Syntax exit:stops the current running label


Syntax:end :stops script and exit screenBot
stop or stopScript:stops running script only, does not close screenBot

##Security and password protection

provides security features for securing scripts and preventing random users from running scripts on your system
Syntax:
setSecurityPassword <password> : this sets a password for screenBot preventing users from tamperimg with commands
activateSecurity : now this is what activates security mode on screenBot4 
You have to set a security password for this to work

disactivateSecurity : disactivate security mode

guestUser on/off  : tell screenBot4 to allow guestmode (works when a password is set and security is active) 
by default screenbot prompts for password on start if security is activated guest mode allows low risk and 
simple commands to run without requesting a password



##loop on texts

allow users run commands on each text found on screen 
syntax: textOnScreen language text command
saves details of text iv variables:
{{textx}} : x location of the text
{{texty}} : y location of the text
{{textwidth}} : width of the text
{{textheight}} : height of the text
{{textcenterx}} : x center location of the text
{{textcentery}} : y center location of the text

example:
~~ highlight all "move" texts on screen
textOnScreen eng move run highlighter: ?arg {{textx}} {{texty}}  {{textwidth}} {{textheight}}

~~ close script when all highlighting is done
stopScript

highlighter:
~~ define our variables
set {{xtxt}} ?arg0 
set {{ytxt}} ?arg1
set {{wdthtxt}} ?arg2
set {{hgthtxt}} ?arg3

~~ calculate the position and width of the text  
set {{toprightx}} ?calc "{{xtxt}} + {{wdthtxt}}"

~~ move to text
move {{xtxt}} {{ytxt}} 2

~~ highlight
drag {{toprightx}} {{ytxt}} 2

~~ optional just click to unhighlight (clear highlight)
click

Usage: perform workflows on text,text detection


##text split and run

splits and run commands based on each splitted texts
use ?run to give command to run
saves each piece of the text in {{item}} before running

Syntax: splitRun <text> ?run <command>

Example:
~~ splits and run the text word by word
splitRun this is screenBot 4 ?run msg {{item}}
~~ you can give a text file to split the file line by line instead

splitRun splitfile.txt ?run msg {{item}}

use ?token at the begining to split the word by a given word or character or
?token-es "<escape character>" to split using escape character instead

Example:
~~ splits the text in every "B" found in text and run the command

splitRun ?token "B" this is screenBot 4 ?run msg {{item}}


Usage: bruteforce,validation


##emit command

Advanced shell display. Prints text to the shell with optional semantic color modes and inline color markers.

Syntax

emit <text...>
emit:<mode> <text...>        # modes: info, warn, error, or a color name
emit color <color> <text...> # alternate form for custom color


?em super argument 
the ?em argument functions as an Inline color markers

?em-<fg> — set foreground (e.g. ?em-red)

?em-<fg>-<bg> — set foreground and background (e.g. ?em-green-blue)
the ?em args affect subsequent tokens until changed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE
-----

STEP 1 — VERIFY VERSION
-----------------------
Navigate to your ScreenBot4 installation directory.

If you see **webui4.exe**, you are using the **Professional version** of
ScreenBot4 with WebUI support.

If **webui4.exe** is missing, you are using the **Free version**, which does not
include WebUI access.

---

STEP 2 — LAUNCH WEBUI
---------------------
Start the WebUI directly by double-clicking:
  webui4.exe

By default, the WebUI will launch with:
  Host: 127.0.0.1
  Port: 4444

Then, open your browser and visit:
  http://127.0.0.1:4444

Default credentials:
  Username: admin
  Password: admin

---

STEP 3 — ADVANCED LAUNCH MODES
------------------------------
For advanced control, launch WebUI manually from the command line:

  webui4.exe start webui <host> <port>

Example:
  webui4.exe start webui 192.168.1.10 8080

To limit concurrent logins (max users):
  webui4.exe start webui <host> <port> <maxuser:n>

Example:
  webui4.exe start webui 127.0.0.1 4444 maxuser:3

---

STEP 4 — CONFIGURE SECURITY & PERMISSIONS
-----------------------------------------
Use **webuiconfig.exe** to adjust:
  - Security settings
  - Access control
  - Interface behavior
  - Stream quality and performance

Changes take effect the next time WebUI is launched.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SESSION MANAGEMENT
------------------
• On every new user login, a **new ScreenBot session** is automatically created.  
  (Session creation may take a few seconds.)

• Each session is fully isolated — users can run commands independently without
  interfering with others.

• Hosts can:
  - Monitor active and disconnected users.
  - Track real-time activities and automation progress.
  - View detailed logs and diagnostics in the WebUI CLI status dashboard.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MONITORING & LOGGING
--------------------
The host can monitor all user sessions from the **UI Log Panel**, accessible
through the WebUI tray icon (click "Show Info Window").

This panel displays:
  - Session events
  - Errors, warnings, and system messages
  - Script execution updates
  - Connection logs and activity history

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USER DASHBOARD
---------------
Once logged in, users will see:

  • Live Desktop Stream (if enabled)
  • File Browser
  • Terminal Console
  • Script Builder Interface

Users can:
  - Execute ScreenBot commands (except those restricted by host).
  - Build and run scripts directly in the Script Builder tab.
  - Monitor outputs, logs, and visual results from one interface.

Hosts retain the ability to:
  - Restrict specific tabs or actions.
  - Pause or resume the desktop stream globally.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES & REMINDERS
-----------------
• Each logged-in user operates within an isolated ScreenBot session.
• Hosts can end server at any time from the WebUI tray menu.
• Default login credentials should be changed immediately using webuiconfig.exe.
• For optimal performance, disable audio or lower stream quality on slower networks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
--------
ScreenBot4 Professional WebUI bridges the power of local automation with the
convenience of the web — combining real-time control, multi-user sessions,
visual monitoring, and script building into a single, accessible interface.
